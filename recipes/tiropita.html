            <p> Traditional Greek ‘Tiropitakia’ recipe suitable for every time of the 
                day, as starter or mid-day snack! To prepare this traditional 
                tiropitakia recipe (Greek feta cheese triangles) we crumble the feta 
                cheese and mix it with two different kinds of yellow cheese for extra 
                flavour. We then wrap them with phyllo pastry forming a triangle, 
                brush with melted butter or olive oil and bake them until 
                golden and crispy to perfection.. Simply delicious!

                <li>8 sheets of phyllo pastry</li>
                <li>110g/ 4oz. feta cheese</li>
                <li>170g feta cheese, crumbled (6 oz.)</li>
                <li>50g Gouda cheese, grated (2 oz.)</li>
                <li>50g Parmesan, or regato or Kefalograviera (2 oz.))</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>a splash of milk</li>
                <li>2 tbsp full fat strained yoghurt</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>fresh mint or dill, chopped (optional)</li>
                <li>olive oil or melted butter</li>

            <li>To prepare the tiropitakia, start by preparing the filling. 
                Crush the feta cheese into a large bowl and add the grated 
                cheese, the egg, a splash of milk, the yoghurt and season 
                with freshly ground pepper. Mix well with a spoon to combine 
                the ingredients. (At this point you can add some chopped 
                fresh herbs if you like; some fresh dill or mint will surely 
                lift the flavour).</li>
    
            <li>Preheat the oven at 180C and start preparing the tiropitakia.</li>
    
            <li>Spread one sheet of the phyllo dough on the kitchen counter and 
                with a cooking brush drizzle with some melted butter or olive oil. 
                Spread one more sheet on top and drizzle with some more butter.</li> 
    
            <li>Cut the sheets into three or four lanes (depending on if you 
                like the tiropitakia to be small or larger). At the end of each 
                lane add one tablespoon of the filling. Fold one corner to form a 
                triangle and continue folding the triangle upon itself, until the 
                entire piece of phyllo is used. Continue with the rest phyllo sheets 
                and filling.</li>
    
            <li>Oil the bottom of a large baking tray, place the tiropitakia and 
                brush them with some melted butter on top. Bake in preheated oven 
                at 180C for 25-30 minutes, until golden and crispy.</li>
    
            <li>Serve this delicious Greek feta cheese triangles as a great starter 
                with some Greek salad aside.</li>
